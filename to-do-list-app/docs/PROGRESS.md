## 🔬 Research-Backed Productivity Principles to Implement

### 1. **Deep Work (Cal Newport)**
- Uninterrupted focus blocks (90-120 minutes)
- Eliminate shallow work during deep work sessions
- Track deep work hours per day/week

### 2. **Pomodoro Technique (Francesco Cirillo)**
- 25-minute focus sessions
- 5-minute short breaks
- 15-30 minute long breaks after 4 pomodoros

### 3. **Habit Formation (James Clear - Atomic Habits)**
- Make it obvious: Visual cue system
- Make it attractive: Reward system
- Make it easy: Reduce friction
- Make it satisfying: Streak tracking

### 4. **Two-Minute Rule**
- If task takes < 2 minutes, do it immediately
- Flag tasks as "quick wins"

### 5. **Zeigarnik Effect**
- Breaking tasks into smaller chunks
- Progress tracking to reduce mental load

### 6. **Time Boxing**
- Allocate specific time blocks for tasks
- Parkinson's Law: Work expands to fill time

### 7. **Energy Management**
- Track when you're most productive
- Schedule hard tasks during peak energy
- Easy tasks during low energy

## 💡 Feature Ideas Based on Research

1. **localStorage persistence** - Don't lose tasks on refresh!
2. **Task editing** - Fix typos without deleting
3. **Priority levels** - Focus on what matters
4. **Pomodoro timer** - Built-in focus sessions

### Medium-Term (High Value)
5. **Streak counter** - "7 days of completing tasks!"
6. **Daily goal setting** - "Complete 5 tasks today"
7. **Time tracking** - See where time actually goes
8. **Weekly review** - Reflect on progress

### Long-Term (Research-Driven)
9. **Energy level tracking** - Find your peak hours
10. **Cognitive load warnings** - "You have 15 tasks, too many!"
11. **Optimal scheduling** - AI suggests best time for tasks
12. **Habit stacking** - Link new habits to existing ones
